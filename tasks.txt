repost_modal_taskes:
1) Need to refactor code in these places:
    1. Make post request and call save action in messages controller for creating new message with repost, realisation in reposts controller looks bad
    2. Post variable declaration is in _message.html.haml, it' s bad, because logic should be in controller, but still didn' t find another place for declaration
2) Think about some possible bugs and validations
3) Make search for choosing place to repost
4) Make styles for modal repost window (checkboxes) and for repost into message

messenger:
1) In rooms controller show action think about redirecting on yet existing room with current_user; protection for dual_room works
